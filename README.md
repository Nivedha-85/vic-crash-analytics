Dataset: Utilise the "Crash data from Victoria roads" dataset provided by Transport Victoria.
This dataset contains detailed information on road traffic crashes in Victoria, including variables
such as date, location, crash severity, and contributing factors. The dataset is available in 3 CSV
format files and can be downloaded from iLearn. The following are the files available:
vic_road_crash_data: A single flat file containing a subset of the attributes
Vehicle: The VEHICLE table contains the details of the vehicles involved with an accident. There
can be one or more vehicles involved with one accident only. The accident_no and vehicle_id fields
are the primary keys.
Person: The PERSON table contains the details of the people involved with an accident. There can
be one or more people involved with one accident only. The accident_no and person_id fields are
the primary keys.
Data Dictionary: Provides Supporting documentation of of the above files with further details of
the attributes
Part A Practical Work (Total: 20 marks)
Create a series of 5 visualisations in Tableau or R to analyse and interpret the road crash data. Your
visualisations must address the following:
1. Develop a time series visualisation to examine trends in road crashes over a specified period.
Identify any patterns, trends or anomalies in the data.
2. Create a map visualisation to illustrate the geographic distribution of road crashes across
different regions in Victoria. Highlight areas with higher incidences
3. Design visualisations to explore the severity of crashes (e.g., serious injury, fatal, minor
injury) and how severity levels vary across relevant factors such as location, time, or
demographics.
4. Design visualisations to explore how crash severity varies across vehicle related factors such
as year of manufacture, body style, make, model, and power. Consider whether particular
vehicle types, ages, or specifications are associated with higher crashes or severity outcomes
and present your findings clearly.

1. Explain any data preparation, transformation and cleaning processes undertaken before
analysis.
2. Present each visualisation developed in Part A, accompanied by an in-depth analysis of the
findings and describe the rationale behind choosing specific visualisation types for each
aspect of the analysis.
3. Interpret the patterns, trends, and anomalies observed in the visualisations and discuss the
potential factors contributing to the observed data patterns.
4. Ethics plays a crucial role in data visualization. Discuss and apply three ethical principles
you have adhered to, and explain how they are relevant to data visualisation practices in the
industry
